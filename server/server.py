		For example:
			python3 server.py < test00-input.txt > mysol.txt

		This will cause sys.stdin to read from test00-input.txt instead of the 
		keyboard and have sys.stdout print to the file mysol.txt instead of 
		the terminal.  You can examine the output by looking at mysol.txt. 
		You can quickly determine if the output agrees with with the provided expected
		output test00-output.txt by running

			diff mysol.txt test00-output.txt

		These test files are in the tests.tar.gz file on eClass. 
		There is also a script test server.py that includes the Python 
		code for testing individual functions in the example above. 
		The expected output for this is in test server output.py.

		-Load edmonton graph function
